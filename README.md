##  Project Structure

###  1. Database Setup

- Created a database: `p1_retail_db`
- Created a table: `retail_sales`  
  Includes columns for transaction ID, date/time, customer demographics, product category, quantity, pricing, and sales metrics.

###  2. Data Cleaning

- Checked for and removed null/missing values across key columns.
- Fixed column name typos (e.g., `quantiy` â†’ `quantity`).

###  3. Data Exploration

Performed basic EDA tasks:

- Total number of sales records
- Count of unique customers
- Number of product categories

###  4. Business Queries & Analysis

SQL queries were written to answer:

- Sales on a specific date
- High-quantity purchases in November 2022
- Total and average sales by category
- Average customer age for Beauty category
- High-value transactions (total sales > 1000)
- Transaction count by gender and category
- Top 5 highest-spending customers
- Unique customer count by category
- Sales by time-of-day shift (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

##  Example Analysis Snippet â€“ Shift Classification

```sql
SELECT *,
  CASE
    WHEN DATEPART(hour, sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
    WHEN DATEPART(hour, sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS shift
FROM sales_data;
```

## 🧱 Project Structure

### 🔹 1. Database Setup

- Created a database: `p1_retail_db`

### 🔹 2. Data Cleaning

- Checked for and removed null/missing values across key columns.
- Fixed column name typos (e.g., `quantiy` → `quantity`).

### 🔹 3. Data Exploration

- Total number of sales records
- Count of unique customers
- Number of product categories

### 🔹 4. Business Queries & Analysis

SQL queries were written to answer:

- Sales on a specific date
- High-quantity purchases in November 2022

    ELSE 'Evening'
  END AS shift
FROM sales_data;
```
